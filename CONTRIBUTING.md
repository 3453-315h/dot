# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please refer to the following guidelines.

## Suggested Guidelines

1. When opening a pull request (PR), the title should be clear and concise in describing the changes. The PR description can include a more descriptive log of the changes.
2. If the pull request (PR) is linked to a specific issue, the PR should be linked to the issue. You can use the [Closing Keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) in the PR description to automatically link the issue. Merging a PR will close the linked issue.
